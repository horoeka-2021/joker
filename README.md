# Count-up Online store

In this challenge you'll build part of a fictitious Online store "Count-up"


## Setup

After cloning this repo

```sh
cd joker && npm i
npm run dev
```


## Starting place

* All of the React components are in place.
* You can find the beer data in `data/beers.js`.
* Redux has been installed, but not yet configured.
* The `actions` and `reducers` folders have been created, but no actions or reducers have been created yet.
* The beer listing displays the beers, but the _Add to cart_ link doesn't do anything yet.

Before we jump into the code editor, let's do some thinking about what we need to accomplish.
